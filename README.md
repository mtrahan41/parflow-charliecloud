# Parflow Container

This is basic setup for running the ParFlow container image.   Running both 

Please report issues at the ParFlow issue tracker: https://github.com/parflow/parflow/issues

## Install Docker, Podman, Charliecloud or Singularity

The container image should work with any of the popular systems.   Docker is the most popular but Podman and Singularity have also been used to run this image.

Documentation for downloading and installing these container systems is available at: https://docs.docker.com/ , https://podman.io/ and https://sylabs.io/

## Download the ParFlow coontainer example repository

This example repository has scripts and input for running a simple ParFlow example under Docker.

### Clone with git

If you have git installed, you can clone the example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parflow/docker.git
```

### Download zip file

If you do now have git, you can download a zip file of the example:

https://github.com/parflow/docker/archive/master.zip

## Running a ParFlow input file

Running ParFlow using the container instance is similiar to how ParFlow
is run from the command line using Python or TCL.  The python/tclsh command is
replaced with a platform specific script.

Where you see:

```bash
tclsh <arguments>
```

```bash
python <arguments>
```

to run with the the container instance use the provided script:

```bash
./bin/parflow.sh <arguments>
```

On Windows the script to use is parflow.bat.

The first time you execute the 'parflow.bat' or 'parflow.sh' script
Docker will download the ParFlow image.  This requires an internet
connection and may take several minutes.

The file extension of the ParFlow input (.py or .tcl) will be used to
determine which script engine to use.

### Example on Unix/Linux/MacOS

To execute the default_single Python test case provided with this download:

```bash
./bin/parflow.sh default_single.py 1 1 1
```

To execute the TCL default_single TCL test case provided with this download:

```bash
./bin/parflow.sh default_single.tcl 1 1 1
```

This wrapper script is invoked as one would invoke TCL outside of
docker.  In this case we supply the TCL ParFlow input file (which is
always required) and the core topology (in this case a 1
core along the  X/Y/Z axis).

To run this same problem in parallel:

```bash
./bin/parflow.sh default_single.tcl 2 1 1
```

Will split the problem in the X axis across two cores.

### Example on Windows

To execute the default_single test case run with

```PowerShell
.\bin\parflow.bat default_single.tcl 1 1 1
```

This wrapper script is invoked as one would invoke TCL outside of
docker.  In this case we supply the TCL ParFlow input file (which is
always required) and the core topology (in this case a 1
core along the  X/Y/Z axis).

To run this same problem in parallel:

```PowerShell
.\bin\parflow.bat default_single.tcl 2 1 1
```

Will split the problem in the X axis across two cores.

#### Running Docker with multiple cores on Windows

Docker needs to be configured to run on multiple cores under Windows.
In the Docker Desktop go to the Settings -> Advanced tab to set the
number of CPU's docker will use.  This will be a small number,
normally 1 or 2, by default.

This panel also controls the memory allocated for the Docker
instances.  The default memory is typically 1 or 2 GB.  For large
problems this will need to be increased.

#### Special file issues on Windows

Windows Docker support currently has issues with file ownership.  The
files created when will be owned by the Administrator account.
The files are readable by you and you can delete files BUT directories
can only be deleted by an Administrator account.

We are looking at how to better manage this issue; this is a known
'feature' of Docker on Windows.

## Output

The output of running the example will be placed in the
example directory.

Below is a list of files from a run done on windows.  The '*.txt' and
'*.log' files contain summary information about the turn.  The '*.silo'
and '*.pfb' files are the same output, simply stored in two different
formats.  The Silo files are viewable using Visit
(https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/).  See the
ParFlow user manual for more information on output.

## Running your ParFlow problem in a container.

Running your input with the Docker has one restriction using the
provided script; all input files must be contained in the current
working directory.  This includes the initial TCL input file and all
files that are used in the problem.  Subdirectories in the current
working directory are fine and will be available in the instance.
Soft links will not work.

Once you have all the files in the current working directory simply invoke
the script with the TCL file.  For example on Windows:

```PowerShell
.\bin\parflow.bat my_problem_setup.tcl
```

It is possible to share other directories with the cointainer instance but
that is beyond the scope of this document.  You will need to bind
additional directories by changing the Docker command line.  See
Docker documenation for information on sharing host file systems with
the Docker instance.

## Running a specific version of ParFlow

By default the supplied script will download and execute the latest
version ParFlow.  Other released versions of ParFlow are available on
DockerHub (starting with version 3.5.0).  To run a specific version of
ParFlow edit the script to change the version to match your desired
version, for example to run version 3.12.0:

```PowerShell
docker run -v %cd%:/data parflow/parflow:version-3.12.0 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
```
